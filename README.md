# Welcome to Agiphy!

This exercise was a first try at the async-fetch functions, and a first experience in using external APIs.

check it out at: https://luciesteigleder.github.io/agiphy/

# How does it work?

## Fetching data 

When the user validates the form with a name and a country, the Agiphy API will send back data on how the average age of people wearing this name in this country.


# How to run this project

Just type a name and choose a country! 
If you want to test it out again, no need to refresh, the new data will just appear below the first one.

# Self-reflection and future improvements

This project never had the ambition to be more than a small exercise. The design could be definitively improved!
